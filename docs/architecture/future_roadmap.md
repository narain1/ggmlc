# ggmlc Architecture & Future Roadmap

This document covers how `ggmlc` is built today, why it was designed this way, and what we're building next.

---

## 1. Core Architecture Decisions

### GGUF as the Native Container
Instead of inventing a custom file format, `ggmlc` outputs standard **GGUF v3** files:
- Header metadata stores the entire execution graph spec (`ggmlc.graph_spec` JSON), tensor descriptors, dynamic shapes, and storage classes.
- Weight tensors are stored in memory-aligned binary buffers (supporting FP32, Q8_0, Q4_0, and k-quants).
- **Why this matters**: Immediate compatibility with existing tooling (`gguf-py`, Hugging Face Hub), zero-copy memory mapping (`mmap`), and fast load times.

### Dual Targets: Generic Runtime + Standalone C++ Project Export
When you compile a model in `ggmlc`, you can target two modes:
1. **GGUF Binary**: Streamed to disk and executed by the generic `ggmlc-runtime` / Python runner without any recompilation.
2. **Standalone C++ Project (`ggmlc.codegen`)**: Generates a self-contained directory containing `<Model>.h`, `ggmlc_main.cpp`, and `CMakeLists.txt`.
- **Why this matters**:
  - Full transparency: You can inspect every line of C++ graph construction and stride math.
  - Zero Python dependencies at deployment: Compile directly with MSVC, GCC, or Clang.
  - Foundation for **BYOK (Bring Your Own Kernel)** and **Agentic Custom Kernel Optimization**, letting developers (or AI coding agents) swap in hand-tuned or synthesized micro-kernels for hot fused subgraphs.

### Clean Separation Between Compiler and Runtime
- **`ggmlc` (Compiler)**: Python-based frontend, Canonical IR functional DAG, shape inferencing, quantization, optimization passes, and C++ code generator.
- **`ggmlc-runtime` (Execution Engine)**: Pure C++17 library linking against GGML. Zero dependency on Python, PyTorch, or libtorch.
- **Why this matters**: Makes it trivial to embed into native desktop apps, server binaries, mobile apps (Android/iOS), or foreign language bindings (Rust, Swift, WASM).

### Semantic Convergence via Passes (Not Brittle Ingestion Hacks)
Different ML frameworks represent the same computation differently:
- PyTorch (`torch.export`) emits mid-level ATen ops (`aten.layer_norm`, `aten._softmax`, `aten.scaled_dot_product_attention`).
- JAX (`jax.make_jaxpr`) decomposes math into RISC-style primitives (`lax.reduce_sum`, `lax.max`, `lax.exp`, `lax.div`).

Rather than trying to force both frontends into identical ASTs at the ingestion boundary, `ggmlc` ingests them cleanly into Canonical IR and relies on the **Optimization Pipeline (`transforms/fusion.py`)** to pattern-match decomposed subgraphs (LayerNorm, RMSNorm, Softmax, SwiGLU, BiasGELU, Conv+ReLU) into fused execution kernels. Both frontends converge to the same high-performance GGML execution graph with exact numerical parity.

## 2. Living Baseline: Continuous Model Zoo & Differential Parity

- **Current Zoo (30 validated models)**: Spans Vision-CNN (ResNet, MobileNetV3, ConvNeXt, EfficientNet, DenseNet, RegNet), Detection (SSDLite), Vision Transformers (ViT-B/16), Text Embeddings (MiniLM, BGE-M3), Encoders (BERT, DistilBERT), SLMs (GPT-2, Qwen-2.5-0.5B, Gemma 3), Audio Seq2Seq (Whisper-Tiny Encoder & Decoder), and Multimodal Vision-Language (OpenAI CLIP Vision, Text, and End-to-End Similarity).

---

## 3. Implemented Capabilities & What We're Building Next

### ✅ Completed: End-to-End Pipelines & Pre/Post-Processing
- **Vision Preprocessing Subsystem (`ggmlc.pipeline.vision`)**:
  - Continuous bicubic, bilinear, nearest resampling.
  - Aspect-ratio letterboxing, center crop, normalization (`(x - mean) / std`), channel permutations (NCHW $\leftrightarrow$ NHWC).
  - Introspection and mathematical parity verification against `torchvision.transforms` (`from_torchvision`, `verify_torchvision_parity`).
  - Native C++ engine (`stb_image` decode + fast SIMD bicubic interpolation + normalization) in `runtime/src/pipeline/image.cpp`.
- **Tokenization Subsystem (`ggmlc.pipeline.tokenizer`)**:
  - Byte-level Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) for CLIP and GPT-2, WordPiece for BERT.
  - Automatic metadata export to standard GGUF tokenizer keys (`tokenizer.ggml.*`).
  - Native C++ tokenizer engine with regex pre-tokenization in `runtime/src/pipeline/tokenizer.cpp`.
  - Introspection from Hugging Face processors/tokenizers (`from_huggingface`, `from_huggingface_tokenizer`).
- **Raw Input Ingestion in `ggmlc-run`**:
  - Direct execution from CLI with `--image <path>` and `--text <string>`.

## 4. Next Priorities On The Roadmap

### B. Low-Level Nanobind Tensor Ops API
In addition to the high-level model runner (`runner(x)`), we will expose granular, direct Python bindings to GGML tensor operations:
- **Interactive Prototyping & Debugging**: Call individual operators (`ggmlc.ops.matmul(a, b)`, `ggmlc.ops.norm(x, eps)`, `ggmlc.ops.flash_attn(q, k, v)`) directly on NumPy / host / CUDA buffers.
- **Micro-Benchmarking**: Profile and test standalone kernel efficiency and memory bandwidth on custom hardware without setting up full graphs.
- **Lightweight Tensor Math**: Fast native CPU/GPU array operations on edge devices without needing heavy frameworks installed.

### C. Bring Your Own Kernel (BYOK) & Agentic Kernel Optimization
The standalone C++ export creates a direct path for custom hardware acceleration:
- **Manual BYOK**: Drop custom SIMD (AVX2, AVX-512, NEON) or CUDA kernels directly into the generated C++ project.
- **Agentic Optimization**: AI coding agents can analyze the exported C++ graph, detect performance bottlenecks in hot fused subgraphs, synthesize optimized micro-kernels, compile, benchmark them in a loop, and integrate the fastest variant back into the project.

### D. Hardware Targets & Ecosystem Integration
1. **Apple Silicon Metal (MPS)**:
   - Native `ggml-metal` backend with unified memory zero-copy buffers on macOS and iOS.
2. **WebAssembly & WebGPU**:
   - In-browser execution via Emscripten and WebGPU compute shaders for zero-server-cost client inference.
3. **Rust Bindings (`ggmlc-rs`)**:
   - Safe, idiomatic Rust crate wrapping the native C++ runtime for systems and backend applications.
4. **Mobile Platforms (Android NDK & iOS)**:
   - Packaged static/shared libraries with JNI and Swift wrappers for on-device mobile deployment.
5. **AMD ROCm (HIP) & Vulkan**:
   - Broad GPU compatibility across AMD Radeon, Intel Arc, and integrated GPUs.

### E. Advanced Quantization & Graph Optimizations
1. **Advanced PTQ (AWQ & GPTQ)**:
   - Activation-aware weight quantization and second-order error compensation integrated directly into Canonical IR passes.
2. **Mixed-Precision K-Quants**:
   - Automated per-tensor sensitivity analysis selecting the optimal GGML k-quant mix (`Q4_K_M`, `Q5_K_M`, `Q6_K`) to maximize throughput while minimizing perplexity loss.
3. **Wide-FFN Q8 Prefill Parity (Qwen / LLaMA)**:
   - Residual multi-chunk prefill gap (~0.84x–0.90x vs `llama.cpp` on pp512/pp1024) after graph buckets + fusion A/Bs; likely Q8 GEMM tile/layout density on fat FFNs. Deferred from the llama.cpp parity PR once e2e chat wall-clock embraced.
4. **Attention Kernel Specialization**:
   - FlashAttention v2/v3 kernels for long-context execution ($L > 2048$).
   - Sliding-window and chunked local attention lowerings (e.g. for Gemma 3 and Mistral architectures).
5. **Static Arena Planning**:
   - Interval-graph lifetime analysis to pre-allocate a single static scratchpad buffer, eliminating all runtime memory allocations during forward passes.

### F. High-Throughput Serving & Dynamic KV-Cache
1. **Paged KV-Cache**:
   - Block-allocated virtual memory management for autoregressive decoders, eliminating VRAM fragmentation during multi-turn generation.
2. **Continuous Dynamic Batching**:
   - Iteration-level scheduling and request preemption for concurrent multi-user serving.
3. **Speculative Decoding Loops**:
   - Paired execution of lightweight draft SLMs (e.g. Qwen-2.5-0.5B) with larger target models to accelerate token generation throughput.

### G. Multimodal & Extended Frontends
1. **ONNX & SafeTensors Ingestion**:
   - Direct parsing of standard ONNX computational graphs into Canonical IR.
2. **Vision-Language & Multimodal Models**:
   - Cross-attention and vision-projection architectures (CLIP, LLaVA, Florence-2).
3. **Diffusion Architectures**:
   - Ingestion and optimization of UNet and Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbones.
